    Hi, I'm Sebastian!
{{< /h2 >}}

I'm a UX engineer and frontend developer from Zurich, Switzerland. Born and raised in Germany however, living in Zurich since 2005.

Besides being a UX engineer and frontend developer, I am also a founder and entrepreneur, a project and team manager, having a track record working as freelancer, as corporate employee and startup CEO.

### Founding a company&hairsp;&mdash;&hairsp;Quiply

My most recent project was to grow a startup company developing a white-label mobile app platform called [**Quiply**](https://www.quiply.com) enabling large organizations to communicate and coordinate themselves better. We chose a hybrid app approach for the mobile app which we could leverage for building an accompanying web app. 

<!-- The above mentioned startup company did also deliver some custom projects to various clients, such as a mobile app for bicycle manufactures and buyers of their products&hairsp;&mdash;&hairsp;the [**CyBike app**](https://www.cybike.de/). -->

### Before that
A few years ago, I was looking for language exchange partners to improve my French and Spanish but couldn’t find a good website where language learners could find peers to meet in person. So, I developed the [Languagefriends](http://www.languagefriends.net/en/) web site in my leisure time. At that time I was working as a project manager for a large insurance corporation and hadn’t done any development work for more than 10 years. So, got back into development then. 

A long time ago, though, during my studies, I used to work as a freelance frontend developer, using tables, inline font tags and spacer gifs.

These times fortunately are long gone and by now I’d call myself a CSS/HTML enthusiast and senior expert.

### Studies

Oh, yes, some time ago I studied Business Engineering&hairsp;&mdash;&hairsp;in German *Wirtschaftsingenieurwesen*&hairsp;&mdash;&hairsp;at [University of Karlsruhe, Germany](https://www.kit.edu/kit/english/index.php), finishing with a *Diplom* degree. At that time this was the German equivalent to a University master degree.

And for those who are keen to know, I also used to work as a Snowboarding instructor about 20 years ago for some time.
