# Running local server

When developing, run "hugo server --verbose -D".

In order to also compile scss files to css files, run "gulp watch" in another terminal window.

# Deployment

Run ```gulp styles``` locally to generate updated CSS from SCSS, then push to github. Netlify will run ```hugo``` automatically
whenever new code is pushed to github.
